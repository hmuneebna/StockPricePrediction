Data:
Data is retrieved from Yahoo Finances to receive a record of the stock prices at opening and closing.
If there is a need to check other stocks to make sure the program works, the ticker symbols need to be renamed near the top of the code.
There are numbers that could be changed to change the prediction days and how many days before the present day to use as data.
